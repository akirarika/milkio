# 0.5.0 - Sky Tree

> The golden sunset gradually fades from the city, street lights and signs are lit up one after another. Gazing down from the Sky Tree, the entire Tokyo looks like a gradually brightening starry sky, bustling and dazzling. "Only you would buy me ice cream," Alice clings tightly to Kurokawa's sleeve, as if she might lose him at any moment, "you would stay with me, be gentle, and... never treat me like a monster. I... might have fallen for you!"

## Testing

Milkio has primarily improved its testing procedures:

- Tests now have colorful, attractive output

- Previously, tests would terminate upon encountering a failure; now they will not, and will instead complete all tests

- For streams, when a test fails, it will not hang but will be correctly identified as a failure
