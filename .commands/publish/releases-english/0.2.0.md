# 0.2.0 - First Encounter

> The television was reporting the news, and Alice was the superpowered individual who had escaped from the lab. Kurokawa muttered to himself, wondering what kind of trouble he had gotten himself into by taking pity on her and bringing her home. She may have lost her memory, having no knowledge of her past experiences, and would only cling to Kurokawa, tugging at his sleeve and saying, "I'm hungry."

## Commands

Now, Milkio can also be used to develop small tools that run in the terminal! [Documentation](https://milkio.fun/essentials/command)

At `/apps/$/` directory will be treated as a command. For commands, usage is similar to regular APIs, with the exception of the parameter format.

You now have two parameters: `commands` and `options`. These parameters are automatically parsed by Milkio from `argv`. Take a look at the examples below, which show the executed command and the obtained `params`.

```bash
./app say hello world --foo=bar --enable
```

```ts
params: {
  commands: ["hello", "world"],
  options: {
    foo: "bar",
    enable: true,
  },
}
```

To learn more about usage, please read the [documentation](https://milkio.fun/essentials/command)
