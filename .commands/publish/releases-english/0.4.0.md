# 0.4.0 - Anonymous Call

> "Seventy-five thousand yen, for a university student like you, should be enough." A cold mechanical voice came from the phone, apparently to avoid revealing the speaker's identity. "Although I don't know why she calms down when she's with you, it saves us a lot of trouble. Take her to the top of Tokyo Skytree, the highest place in the whole of Tokyo. The high altitude is a natural barrier, that's her cage. Bring her here, wait until exactly 10 o'clock at night, find a reason to quietly leave, and we will take care of the rest."

## ðŸš¨ Destructive Usage Changes: execute Related Methods

> We will strive to maintain compatibility, but there may be some destructive usage changes before the 1.0 version of Milkio is released.

Previously, the usage of execute-related methods was as follows:

```ts
app.execute('foo/bar/baz', 'some-params', { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, { ... })
```

Now, the parameters have been changed to a fetch-like usage:

```ts
app.execute('foo/bar/baz', {
   params: 'some-params',
   headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
   ...
})
```

## Improved Failure Types

Now, the `TYPE_SAFE_ERROR` failure return value type in Milkio Client is more accurate, and we can even use editor auto-completion for code like `foo.fail.data.path === "$input.password"`. Yes, strings like `"$input.password"` can also be auto-completed and errors can be detected.

Update command: `cd ./packages/client && bun i milkio-client@0.4.0`

## Upgrade

```
bun i milkio@0.4.0
```
