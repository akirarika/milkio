# 0.1.0 - Prologue

> At the end of the world, Kurokawa remembered the first time he saw Alice. At that time, Kurokawa was walking along the busiest street in Tokyo, where a girl was sitting there, dirty and disheveled. Hugging her knees, her eyes were filled with confusion and helplessness, as if she were a lonely kitten, abandoned by the world.

## Happy Birthday

This is the first version of Milkio!

In fact, before the release, I have spent nearly a year polishing it. So, despite being just released, Milkio is quite complete, with beautiful documentation and comprehensive tools. I hope you like it!

You might be wondering what the opening paragraph is about. Many open-source projects like to give each version a somewhat melodramatic name, and I find this tradition quite interesting! I wanted to use chapters of a novel as version names, and use paragraphs from the novel as the opening of the release notes. The novel itself is fictional, and the paragraphs are also fabricated by me, but if given the chance, I might turn it into a real novel and publish it (just a thought).

Anyway! I hope you like Milkio!
